# Parkinson's Disease Prediction using SVM

## Project Description
This project aims to predict Parkinson's Disease using voice feature data through a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It involves data preprocessing, standardization, model training, and evaluation to create a predictive system for early identification based on vocal characteristics.

## Features
- Data loading and initial exploration.
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`.
- SVM classifier implementation.
- Model training and accuracy evaluation.
- Predictive system for new input data.

## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Ensure `parkinsons.csv` is in the project directory.**
3.  **Execute the Jupyter/Colab notebook** to perform data analysis, model training, and prediction.
